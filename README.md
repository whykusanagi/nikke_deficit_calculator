## Nikke: Goddess of Victory Deficit Calculator

This is a web-based calculator designed to help players of Nikke: Goddess of Victory determine the CP (Combat Power) deficit between their Stage CP (recommended CP for a stage) and Team CP (their actual team's CP). The CP deficit is a crucial factor in Nikke, as it can significantly impact battle outcomes.

**Features:**

- **Simple Interface:** Enter your Stage CP and Team CP values, and the calculator instantly displays the CP deficit percentage.
- **Conditional Formatting:** The background color of the stat penalty output dynamically changes based on the severity of the deficit (red for high deficit, orange for moderate deficit, yellow for minor deficit, green for no deficit).
- **Data-Driven:** The stat penalty calculation is based on a power law formula derived from data analysis (source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/yur3la/nikke_resource_sheets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/yur3la/nikke_resource_sheets/)).
